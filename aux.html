        <p>Aux Send Shitty Limits' story.  Limits story.  Auxbout.  There is not much to explain.  The name is hewn roughly from these referents: a public-television Saturday hour devoted Central Texas song and story; a box to modulate the dynamic range of a line-level signal fed into it and out again; everything that is no good to anyone.  The name names an episodic practice whose elements are chance, inattention, and a faint but perennial hope that from chance and inattention and no directed effort some interesting interval will be born.</p>
        <p>But what in practice does that mean.  Almost nothing.  A transducer can go one way--sound to electricity--or the reverse.  Start with the one.  We do.  Pick a reliable, costly one.  Pick an unreliable, low-cost one.  Form a tandem.  Listen to what happens.  Maybe nothing.  Probably nothing.  Try something different.  Remember that there is no sound source.  That explains non-results.</p>
